# Web-Scrapping
This notebook demonstrates fundamental data extraction and preprocessing techniques using Python. It covers:

Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup – extracting tabular data from a Wikipedia page and saving it as a CSV.

JSON Data Handling – reading and normalizing nested JSON data for structured analysis using json_normalize.

PDF Text Extraction – using pdfplumber to extract text from PDF files and convert the results into a structured Pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning in Excel Files – handling missing values by applying mean, median, and mode imputation, and dropping rows with excessive null values.

These tasks reflect a practical understanding of basic data preprocessing methods essential for Business Intelligence and Analytics workflows.
